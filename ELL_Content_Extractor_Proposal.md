# Proposal: MVP Submission for ELL Content Extractor

**Date:** April 12, 2025

---

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 🔐 Secure Login Automation

Automated login using Puppeteer, with session persistence to avoid re-authentication between scraping sessions.

### 📄 Dynamic Content Extraction

Supports comma-separated module URLs, navigates to each, and extracts dynamic (JavaScript-rendered) content while removing ads, navbars, and other distractions.

### 🧾 PDF Generation + HTML Preview

Users can preview a cleaned-up version of the extracted content in-browser or generate a print-ready PDF with consistent formatting.

### 🖥️ User Interface

- Separate login and scraping flows
- Preview opens in a new tab
- Persistent sessions with manual reset support

### 🧩 Project Structure

Built with a clean MVC layout (Express.js + EJS), easily maintainable and extendable. Setup is fully documented in the README.

---

## 📁 Included

- Fully working source code with setup instructions
- Sample output PDFs and HTML previews in `/output/`
- Updated README with troubleshooting and usage guide

---

## 📌 What’s Next (Optional Enhancements)

- Apply ELL's branding/layout template to PDF (headers, footers, logo)
- Add custom header/footer styling to match style guides
- Add CLI/script-only mode
- SSO or captcha handling (if needed for other platforms)
